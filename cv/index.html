	<h2>Hi there, I'm Fawaz!</h2>
	<p>Just as a brief introduction. I am currently doing my PhD in bioinformatics under <a href="https://www.helmholtz-hzi.de/en/research/research-topics/anti-infectives/drug-bioinformatics/olga-kalinina/">Prof. Dr. Olga Kalinina</a> and <a href="https://www.helmholtz-hzi.de/en/research/research-topics/anti-infectives/drug-bioinformatics/olga-kalinina/">Prof. Dr. Tobias Marschall</a>. I am mainly working on pangenomes and pangenome analysis to understand Myxobacteria and its natural products.</p>
	<p>I am working right now at <a href="https://www.helmholtz-hzi.de/en/the-hzi/locations/hips-saarbruecken/about-hips/">HIPS</a> (Helmholtz Institute for Pharmaceutical Research) in Saarbrücken, Germany. And in October 2020 moving to Düsseldorf, Germany to continue at the Uniklinik there.</p>
	<p>I am very interested in the use of graphs and graph algorithms in genetics, genomes, and pangenomes. I find algorithms and programming very facinating in general, which was my motivation to go from Bioengineering to Bioinformatics in the first plce.</p>

	<p>You can find a my CV <a href="fawaz_dabbaghie_resume.pdf">here</p>. Please feel free to browse the <a href="https://fawaz-dabbaghieh.github.io/projects/">projects</p> section for my latest projects I am working on.
