	<h2>Hi there, I'm Fawaz!</h2>
	<p>Just as a brief introduction. I am currently doing my PhD in bioinformatics under <a href="https://www.helmholtz-hzi.de/en/research/research-topics/anti-infectives/drug-bioinformatics/olga-kalinina/">Prof. Dr. Olga Kalinina</a> and <a href="https://zbi-www.bioinf.uni-sb.de/en/junior-groups/algorithms-computational-genomics.html">Prof. Dr. Tobias Marschall</a>. I am mainly working on genome graphs and pangenomes, I have looked into these topics in both bacteria and human and mostly worked on developing tools that work with genomic graphs.</p>
	<p>I worked at <a href="https://www.helmholtz-hzi.de/en/the-hzi/locations/hips-saarbruecken/about-hips/">HIPS</a> (Helmholtz Institute for Pharmaceutical Research) in Saarbrücken, Germany for the first year of my PhD then moved to the university of Düsseldorf end of 2020 where I'm still working on my PhD there.</p>
	<p>I am very interested in the use of graphs and graph algorithms in genetics, genomes, and pangenomes. I find algorithms and programming very fascinating in general, which was my motivation to go from Bioengineering to Bioinformatics in the first palce.</p>

	<p>You can find a my CV <a href="files/fawaz_dabbaghie_resume.pdf">here</a>. Please feel free to browse the <a href="projects/">projects</a> section for my latest projects I am working on.</p>
