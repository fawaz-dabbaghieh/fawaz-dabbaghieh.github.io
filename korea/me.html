        <p>I am currently doing my PhD in Bioinformatics at the University of D&uuml;seldorf in Germany &#x1f913;</p>
        <p>I have traveled mostly in Europe and the Middle East, I came to Korea for the first time last year and loved it, I started since learning Korean but my progress been somewhat limited as work takes most of my time unfortunately. However, I am planning to move to Korea next year and study Korean for 6 months at SNU, and there's a big probability that I start doing my postdoc at SNU as well :)</p>

        <p>I also play the piano since I was 14 and participated in a couple of amateur competitions, I wanted to study
            music long time ago, but then got into science and liked it and decided to continue my career in research
            and keep playing piano as a hobby. :)</p>
