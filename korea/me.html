<p><strong>Hi Everyone!</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My name is Fawaz, I am Syrian/German, and currently doing my PhD in Bioinformatics at the University of D&uuml;seldorf in Germany.</p>
<p>I am visiting Korea alone until the 3rd of November and would love to make some friends along the way :)</p>
<p>I have traveled mostly in Europe and the Middle East, and this is my first time in an East Asian country. I have been dreaming about coming to Korea for a while, as I love spicy Korean food and Korean movies and dramas :D</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let's go out for a walk or a meal and explore the city.</p>
<p>I speak English, Arabic, German, and a little big of French.</p>
